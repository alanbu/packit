# packit
Application to help create packages for the RISC OS Packaging Project.

PackIt provides a tabbed interface with the fields you need to fill in to create a binary package suitable for use with PackMan. It shows errors in a status bar to help you fill in the fields correctly.

It also allows you to update existing packages.

It is designed to cope with the most common types of packages, but can not be used for source packages or packages with multiple components. It can however be used to start on one of these types of packages, as the saved package is a zip file, so the Control and Copyright files can be extracted for use elsewhere.
