PackIt Package creation helper new version released

PackIt version 0.6.4 has now been released.

This release has added support for a new Environment field
for VPF v3.

It also includes a new command line utility to make it easier
to package a program as part of your build process, or from
an Obey file. See the packit help file for details.

Versions of PackIt from 0.6.1 are now distributed via the ROOL
packaging sites. RiscPkg and older version of PackMan may not have
these sources in the list of sources. If this version of PackIt
doesn't appear as an update you probably need to add the following
url to the PackMan sources.

PackIt is a tool to help create RISC OS Packaging Project packages.

It is designed to create the most common types of Binary Package.
If more advanced features of the packaging system are required it
can still be used to make a start on the package which would then
be finished off by hand.

A Binary Package is a package that does not need to be built from
source code. e.g. A program created in an interpreted language
like BASIC or a Strong Help manual.

If you build an application from your own source code you can
either use PackIt on the final build or just use it as a convenient
way to create the Control and Copyright files that can then
be extracted from the package zip file and used as part of the
build process.

PackIt is provided as a RISC OS Packaging Project package in the main
distribution. It can be installed using:

!PackMan available from https://sites.google.com/site/alansriscosstuff/packman

The normal RISC OS Packaging project policy manual has not been
updated with the new fields yet. The latest version can be downloaded
using !PackMan or viewed at:
