PackIt Package creation helper released

PackIt version 0.1 first beta has now been released.

PackIt is a tool to help create RISC OS Packaging Project packages.

It is designed to create the most common types of Binary Package.
If more advanced features of the packaging system are required it
can still be used to make a start on the package which would then
be finished off by hand.

A Binary Package is a package that does not need to be built from
source code. e.g. A program created in an interpreted language
like BASIC or a Strong Help manual.

It can also be used to create a package for a project where the source
code is not provided. Though normally you would have options to create
the package as part of your source in this case.

PackIt will help you create the control records required for the
package and create the final package file as well.

PackIt is provided as a RISC OS Packaging Project package in the main
distribution. It can be installed using either:

!RiscPkg available from http://www.riscpkg.org
or
!PackMan available from http://alanb.drobe.co.uk/packman.htm
