<P>PackIt is a tool to help create RISC OS Packaging Project packages.</P>
<P>It is designed to create the most common types of Binary Package. If more advanced features of the packaging system are required it can still be used to make a start on the package which would then be finished off by hand.</P>
<P>
A Binary Package is a package that does not need to be built from source code. e.g. A program created in an interpreted language like BASIC or a Strong Help manual.
</P>
<P>It can also be used to create a package for a project where the source code is not provided. Though normally you would have options to create the package as part of your source in this case.</P>
<P>PackIt will help you create the control records required for the package and create the final package file as well.</P>
