Beside each of these fields is a popup menu button that will allow you to add a package from the current list of packages known to the Package manager. Selecting an option from this menu will add it to the relevant field or replace the existing version if it is already in the field. The menu will add an entry for the current version of the package. Edit the writeable field after adding the package if you want a different version dependency.
